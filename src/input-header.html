  Polymer is all about leveraging the DOM.

  ==> DOM is the framework
  - component model: the element
  - data flow
  - declarative format

  ==> Custom elements!
  - fewer concepts
  - interoperable and reusable
  - no lock-in

  ==> Polymer helps building custom elements!
  - attributes
  - querySelector
  - addEventListener
  - setters/getters
  - templates
  ==> less boilerplate!

  ==> 3 main concepts:
  - thinking locally: break down the application into bite-sized pieces
                      that each do one job really well with a well-defined
                      interface.
  - leveraging composition: leverage other elements inside an element.
  - mediator pattern: define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
                      Objects do not communicate with each other directly. Instead,
                      they communicate through the mediator.

  The custom element will mediate the communication between sibling elements in the local DOM.
  This means the host will be configuring its children with properties, will listening for events
  coming from the children and deciding what to do. The mediator will be also presenting a common
  simplified interface for outside users to use.

  We now added the paper-input element, which is built using Polymer.
  The event changed here: instead of the input event, we are now listening
  for the value-changed event.
